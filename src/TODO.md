## Overview

Creating this chapter as a simple check list for topics that I think should be covered. I'm going to split topics between "background", which should cover general mathematics and "attacks" which should be split between protocols.

Please add to this list freely and we can work through it however we can

## Background

### General

Probably can have a better title...

- [ ] Groups, Rings, Fields, etc.
- [ ] Congruences
- [ ] GCD, LCM
- [ ] Euclid's algorithm
- [ ] Morphisms et al. 
- [ ] Frobenius endomorphism

### Number Theory

Mainly thinking things like

- [ ] Prime decomposition and distribution
- [ ] Euler's theorem
- [ ] Factoring
- [ ] Legrange / Jacobi symbol

### Group Theory

Mainly thinking things like:

- [ ] Abelian groups and their relationship to key-exchange
- [ ] Lagrange's theorem and small subgroup attacks



### Elliptic Curves

- [ ] Weierstrass
- [ ] Montgomery
- [ ] Edwards

### Hyperellipic curves

- [ ] Generalisation of elliptic curves
- [ ] Recovering a group structure using the Jacobian
- [ ] Example: genus one curves, jacobian is isomorphic to the set of points
- [ ] Mumford representation of divisors
- [ ] Computing the order of the Jacobian 


## Attacks

### Elliptic Curves

- [ ] Why Elliptic: show conic sections are weak
- [ ] Anomalous Curve attack
- [ ] Pairing attacks 
- [ ] Singular curves 
- [ ] Weil Descent Attack [https://eprint.iacr.org/2004/240.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2004/240.pdf)
