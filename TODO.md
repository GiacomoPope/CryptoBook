## Overview

Creating this file as a simple check list for topics that I think should be covered. I'm going to split topics between "background", which should cover general mathematics and "attacks" which should be split between protocols.

## Background

### Elliptic Curves

- [ ] Weierstrass
- [ ] Montgomery
- [ ] Edwards

### Hyperellipic curves

- [ ] Generalisation of elliptic curves
- [ ] Recovering a group structure using the Jacobian
- [ ] Example: genus one curves, jacobian is isomorphic to the set of points
- [ ] Mumford representation of divisors
- [ ] Computing the order of the Jacobian 


## Attacks

### Elliptic Curves

- [ ] Why Elliptic: show conic sections are weak
- [ ] Anomalous Curve attack
- [ ] Pairing attacks 
- [ ] Singular curves 
- [ ] Weil Descent Attack [https://eprint.iacr.org/2004/240.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2004/240.pdf)
